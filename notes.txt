    - instance of object in world
    - world location
    - orientation (Quaternion)
    - source object
    - source texture
    - settings
    - model world matrix
- camera
    - world position
    - orientation (Quaternion)
    - pixel_buffer
    - depth_buffer
    - settings
        - resolution (aspect ratio implied)
        - fov
        - distance to near plane
        - distance to far plane
    - world view matrix
    - Projection matrix

steps :
1. initialize context with camera settings (resolution, initial position, etc)
2. load objects & textures
3. declare entities
4. Buffer working space for vertices, primitives, fragments
LOOP
5. Set each value in the depth buffer to float.max 
4. Start Pipeline, do for each entity:
    - Model view transform
    - Vertex processing
    - Projection
    - Geometry processing
    - Clipping
    - Perspective divide
    - Back face culling
    - Transform to Window space
    - Rasterization
    - Fragment processing
        - Lighting, texture mapping, etc
    - Scissor test
    - Depth test
        - Tests could be done before fragment processing to increase performance
    - Write to pixel Buffer
5. Copy pixel buffer to screen
6. Update positions, orientations, etc.
